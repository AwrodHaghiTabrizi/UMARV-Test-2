# UMARV-CV-LaneDetection

Repository for UMARV Computer Vision for the purpose of solving lane detection.

## Models vs Algorithms

The models folder hosts all of our machine learning solutions, while the algorithms folder hosts our hard coded solutions. Each model/algorithm is seperated into its own folder and has its own unique ID.

## Scripts

The src/scripts folder hosts our scripts which provide varrying functionalities from model/algorithm initialization, performance comparison, and dataset generation. To run them, right click on the script and select "Run Python File in Terminal"

## How to interact with this repository

- In your model/algorithm src folder, write the methods that will be used. To actually call the methods, go into the notebooks folder and pick a jupyter notebook environment to work out of.
- Full freedom to create/delete/edit code in your model/algorithm folder.
- Dont change any code in src/script, model_template/algorithm_tempalte, or model/algorithm folders that dont belong to you (unless your tasked with making updates to any of those).
- Work in your own branch. Pull before every work session. Push after every work session. [git tutorial](youtube.com)
